title: Underline Interactive Text Elements
priority: P2
complexity: trivial
status: closed

po_notes: |
  - Usability improvement, not feature change
  - Users missing interactive elements due to brutalist aesthetic
  - Underline is classic hyperlink pattern - universally understood
  - Maintains stark design while adding affordance
  - Low effort, meaningful UX improvement

description: |
  Interactive text elements look like static labels. Users don't know
  they can tap "SEE ALL" or "EDIT". Add underlines to indicate
  tappability while preserving brutalist aesthetic.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "SEE ALL" in Activity section is underlined
  - "EDIT" in Blocked Apps section is underlined
  - Underline style is subtle (thin, matches text color)
  - Tap states still work as expected
  - Consistent underline treatment across all interactive text labels

scope_boundaries:
  in_scope:
    - Underline SEE ALL button
    - Underline EDIT button
    - Any other tappable text labels in dashboard

  out_of_scope:
    - Difficulty badge (different UI pattern, leave as-is for now)
    - Navigation buttons
    - Sheet/modal buttons

  SwiftUI underline modifier:
  ```swift
  Text("SEE ALL")
      .underline()
      .font(AppFont.label(10))
      .tracking(2)
      .foregroundStyle(AppColor.textTertiary)
  ```

  Files to modify:
  - ActivitySection.swift (SEE ALL button)
  - BlockedAppsSection.swift (EDIT button)

  Consider creating a reusable style or ViewModifier if pattern repeats:
  ```swift
  extension Text {
      func interactiveLabel() -> some View {
          self.underline()
              .font(AppFont.label(10))
              .tracking(2)
              .foregroundStyle(AppColor.textTertiary)
      }
  }
  ```
