title: Add launch splash screen
priority: P3
complexity: trivial

po_notes: |
  - Polish item, not core loop
  - Strengthens brand presence on app open
  - Keeps brutalist aesthetic (icon on black, nothing else)
  - 2-second minimum is intentional "weight" - makes the app feel deliberate
  - Dynamic icon reinforces "difficulty as identity"

description: |
  App launches straight into content with no branding moment.
  Add a minimal splash screen showing the current app icon for 2 seconds
  before fading into the main experience. Icon must match the user's
  difficulty setting (icon changes per difficulty level).

acceptance_criteria:
  - Splash screen displays current app icon centered on black background
  - Icon reflects user's difficulty setting (reads from SharedState)
  - Minimum display duration of 2 seconds
  - Smooth fade-out transition to main content
  - Works correctly whether user sees onboarding or dashboard
  - No text, no loading indicators, no animations on the icon itself
