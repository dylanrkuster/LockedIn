title: Add minus prefix to spent amounts in day summaries
priority: P3
complexity: trivial

po_notes: |
  - Pure visual consistency fix
  - Low effort, low risk
  - Affects dashboard "TODAY" section and ActivityHistoryView day headers
  - No functional change

description: |
  Day summaries show "earned +X spent Y net ±Z" but spent amount
  lacks the "-" prefix that earned has with "+". Inconsistent.
  Should be "earned +X spent -Y net ±Z" for visual symmetry.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Dashboard "TODAY" summary shows spent with "-" prefix (e.g., "spent -12")
  - ActivityHistoryView day headers show spent with "-" prefix
  - Earned amounts retain "+" prefix
  - Net amounts retain "+" or "-" as appropriate

implementation_notes: |
  Likely a one-line change in the formatting logic for spent amounts.
  Check: DashboardView (TODAY section) and ActivityHistoryView (day headers).
