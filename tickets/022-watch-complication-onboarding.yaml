title: Add Apple Watch complication setup to widget onboarding
priority: P2
complexity: standard
status: closed

po_notes: |
  - Natural follow-on to watch app we just shipped
  - Improves feature discovery for watch users
  - Fits existing onboarding pattern (WidgetsScreen already exists)
  - Keep scope tight: preview + instructions, no extra steps
  - Only show if user has Apple Watch paired (check via WCSession.isPaired)

description: |
  Users who own an Apple Watch have no guidance on adding the
  LockedIn complication. The current WidgetsScreen only covers
  iPhone widgets. Add a watch complication section following
  the same pattern.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Watch complication section added to WidgetsScreen (after iPhone widgets)
  - Shows circular complication preview matching existing style
  - Includes 3-step instructions for adding via watch face
  - Only displays section if Apple Watch is paired
  - Maintains current screen flow (no new steps added)

implementation_notes: |
  Check WCSession.default.isPaired to conditionally show section.
  Instructions for watch:
    1. Long press watch face
    2. Tap "Edit" then swipe to complications
    3. Select slot then choose "LOCKEDIN"

  Reuse LockScreenWidgetPreview style for watch complication preview
  (circular gauge already matches the watch aesthetic).
