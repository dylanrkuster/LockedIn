type: feature
title: Build Main Dashboard screen
priority: P1
complexity: standard
status: in_progress

po_notes: |
  - This IS the app. The dashboard visualizes the core loop.
  - Must feel immediate and visceral—big balance number, clear progress.
  - No navigation complexity. One screen. No tabs.
  - Primary persona: Recovering Scroller (needs constant visibility into balance)
  - Mock data is fine initially—this unblocks UI iteration before framework integration.
  - Brand voice: direct, terse. No "Great job!" energy.

description: |
  Users need to see their bank balance at a glance. That's it.
  This is the single screen they'll check compulsively. It must communicate:
  how much time they have left and what's blocked. Nothing more.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Large, prominent balance display showing minutes remaining (e.g., "47:32")
  - "minutes left" label below the balance
  - Progress bar showing balance relative to max (based on difficulty)
  - Current difficulty mode displayed (e.g., "Difficulty: HARD")
  - Blocked Apps section showing count and app names
  - Settings gear icon in navigation bar
  - Works with hardcoded/mock data initially
  - Matches brand voice (direct, minimal, no fluff)

technical_notes: |
  - Use SwiftUI
  - Create a BankState model or similar to hold:
    - balance: Int (minutes)
    - maxBalance: Int (based on difficulty)
    - difficulty: enum
  - Use @State or @Observable for now; can migrate to SwiftData later
  - No HealthKit or FamilyControls integration yet
